# Pomodoro Timer Web Application

This project is a responsive React application that showcases the use of front and back-end tools and libraries. It's a Pomodoro timer that includes settings and statistics for the user. The application uses several tools and libraries to provide a complete user experience.

For authentication and authorization, AWS Cognito is used to provide secure access to the application. MongoDB is used as the database to store user data and provide fast and efficient data access. The application uses axios to make requests to the back-end and ensure seamless communication between the front-end and back-end.

In addition, the application uses Redux to manage state, providing an easy-to-use and efficient way of handling application data. With this setup, users can easily manage their Pomodoro sessions, track their progress, and adjust the timer settings as needed.

Overall, this project is an excellent example of how to build a complete and functional web application using a variety of modern tools and libraries. With its user-friendly interface and robust feature set, it provides a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn more about front-end and back-end development.
